<p><b>Zinc</b> is a blueish-white, shiny metal that is obtained from
ore after it is roasted, or heated for a long period of time.  Zinc
was commonly found in ancient India, and is often an ingredient of
sunscreen.  Zinc is the 23rd most commonly found element in the
earth's crust.  Zinc is a necessary element to keep your body
healthy, although having too much zinc in your system can be
harmful.</p>

<h2>Properties</h2>
<p>At room temperature, zinc is not ductile (able to be drawn into
thin strings or wires) or malleable (able to be hammered into thin
sheets or shapes); it is, however, somewhat malleable above 100&deg;C.
Zinc is a solid at room temperature.  Its melting point is 419&deg;C,
and its boiling point is 908&deg;C.  Zinc's density is 7.14g per cm&sup3;.
Zinc is considered a soft metal.  Its hardness is 2.5 on the Mohs
scale, which shows 0-10 the hardness of a material.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Zinc was discovered in 1746 by Andreas Marggraf, a German chemist. 
He discovered it by heating carbon and calamine.  In other words, he
managed to extract Zinc from calamine.  The name Zinc comes from a
German word, Zink, meaning sharp point.  Zinc's atomic number is 30
and its atomic mass is 65.39.</p>

<p>The chemical properties of Zinc include its Ionization Potential, or
the energy required to remove an electron from it, is 9.394 for the
first electron, 17.964 for the second, and 39.722 for the third.  The
heat of fusion (the amount of heat needed to melt or freeze a
fraction of a substance) for Zinc, is 7.322kJ/mol. Zinc's electron
negativity is 1.65, its electrochemical equivalent is 1.22g/amp-hr,
and its electron work function is 4.33eV.</p>

<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>Zinc has many uses.  It is used to galvanize metals, protect them
from rust, and its used as an alloy in things such as pennies and
steel.  The main metal zinc is used in is copper.  In addition to
being used as an alloy, and to galvanize metals, zinc is used in many
other items. For example: roofing, gutters, automobile parts, organ pipes,
batteries, electrical fuses, cosmetics, and others.</p>
